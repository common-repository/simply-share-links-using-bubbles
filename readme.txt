This plugin allow you to show efective information to your users

== Description ==

Basically the bubbles is a way to get the attention of the user to take any of the links on your site or another site in a funny and an effective way.

The bubles are a strategy to give visibility to a post or a product. Users  don't use to look at the side of screen where you usually add your advertisement some wordpress widges or woocomerce widges, with this strategy will get more visits to the desired post or product .

If you are an user of woocomerce and you have a product that needs to be sold urgently, even if you add a widged with the offer on one side you would not have as much visibility as you wish. Therefore it would be much suitable to add a bubble instead because in that way it will not go unnoticed, the user will see it easily and will continue to view and even make click to see the details, so at the end you achieve that your customer look at the product you are interested on.

To sum up, the main idea is to guide the user to a specific page in a funny and completely innovative way that allows to increase traffic within your own site to one or more specific products. The statistics show the more traffic the more sales, then you will greater your chances of selling.

It can also be used to complement Halloween, Christmas, Valentine, since we can show congratulatory message and an image like daily briefings use depending on the imagination of everyone.
